# iidre_uwb_indoor_geoloc
ROS 1 package for **Indoor Geolocalisation** with Ultra wideband (UWB) anchors from [IIDRE](https://www.iidre.com/en/).

## Quickstart
### Part A: Configure anchors and create the map
1. Connect an UWB sensor to an USB port of your ROS computer
2. Power up at least 4 UWB anchors through MicroUSB and place them at the edges of a room (make it easy to measure distances between them)
3. Build & launch [uwbSupervisor](https://github.com/IIDRE/uwbSupervisor), you should see realtime distance data from the 4 anchors and an incorrect map of them 
4. Click `Import infra (flash)` and save the infra file with the `.json` extension
5. Manually open the previous infra JSON file, decide of a world frame in the room and measure distances between anchors to update `X, Y, Z` positions of anchors (in centimeters)
6. Click `Export infra (flash)`, select the edited infra JSON file, and wait a few dozens of seconds for the modal message "export positions: 4"
7. In the uwbSupervisor, check that the top view of the map looks correct, in terms of anchors (black points) and sensor (red point)

### Part B: Publish to ROS
Launch the UWB publisher:
```bash
roslaunch iidre_uwb_indoor_geoloc publish.launch
```

If you use several sensors, you may customize the USB port, world frame id, child frame id, with optional parameters:
```bash
roslaunch iidre_uwb_indoor_geoloc publish.launch publish_anchors:=false name:=robot frame_id:=base_link
```
